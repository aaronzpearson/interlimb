Title: An R Package for Assessing Interlimb Asymmetries
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Aaron Pearson
Maintainer: Aaron Pearson <aaronzpearson@outlook.com>
Description: This package provides the ability to efficiently assess interlimb asymmetries regardless of the parameter tested.    
  The package was built to provide users with one function that encompasses every step that is required to calculate and assess
  interlimb asymmetries. Those with experience with interlimb asymmetries may opt to explore the helper functions 
  to gain greater insights into the various interlimb asymmetry calculations, and their reliability measures.    
  This package is written nearly exclusively in base R to minimize dependencies.
